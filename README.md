# restaurant-page

The Odin Project: Restaurant page

The task was to create a 3-tab restaurant page using webpack and npm. This was my first time ever using these tools and it was quite daunting at first and I had to google a lot to understand what I was doing and why I was doing it, but after some time I got the hang of it (at least for the purposes of this project).

Also, you were supposed to generate each tab 100% through Javascript and without using any html, which was honestly quite annoying and repetitive but I guess a good challenge and way to practice.

I also tried to use classes and divide my code into multiple files to add a bit of logical structure instead of squeezing everything into one file.

By using classes you can now easily add, delete and change menu items and reviews if you need to.

Total time: 7 hours 23 Minutes. Tracked using clockify.
